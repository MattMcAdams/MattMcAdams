## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a designer who codes from a small town in Alabama. After getting a BFA in design and working as a self-taught front-end dev, I now work professionally as a Senior UX Designer and Developer. Aside from the skills directly related to web design and development, I'm also interested in bookmaking, print making, and drawing. When I'm not working I play RPG video games, read fantasy books, and tend to my houseplants.
